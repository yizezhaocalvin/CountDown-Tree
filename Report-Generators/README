Purpose:
	In this project, I design and implement a C++ program that generates a set of reports based on
	data from Canadaâ€™s National Graduate Survey (NGS) from the years 2000-2015. My code is correctly 
	separated into object design categories, and it meets every principle of good software engineering that we
	have covered in class.

Description of the new reports created for requirement 3.1:

(4) - Unemployedment Males, Females and All Report:-------------> we can clearly see is the unemployment percentage high for men or for women or for all in different degrees.
								
	-- the unemployedment percentage for each degrees, by Males and Females and All, for all years and all regions
		-- each degree is a row, and Males and Females and All is a column
		-- each cell show the percentage who were unemployed in that degree, with that gender, for all years and all regions
		   combined, compared to the number of graduates in that degree.
								
								
(5) - Grads Report:----------------> we can clearly see how the number of graduates increase and decrease.

	-- the number of graduates for each year, by region, for all genders and all degrees
		-- each year is a row, and each region is a column
		-- each cell show the number of graduates in that year, with that region, for all genders and all degrees combined.
